Clockify API (v1)
Introduction
By using this REST API, you can easily integrate Clockify with your own add-ons, push and pull data between Clockify and other tools, and create custom add-ons on CAKE.com Marketplace. Whether you’re looking to automate time tracking, generate custom reports, or build other custom integrations, our API provides the flexibility and power you need to get the job done. If you have any questions or run into any issues while using our API, don’t hesitate to reach out to us for help. You can also post questions on Stack Overflow with the Clockify tag to get help from the community.

Authentication
To authenticate your requests to your API, make sure to include either the ‘X-Api-Key’ or the ‘X-Addon-Token’ in the request header, containing your API or Addon key. If your workspace is on a subdomain (e.g. subdomain.clockify.me), you’ll need to generate a new API key in your Profile Settings that will work specifically for that workspace. This ensures that you’re accessing data from the correct workspace and helps maintain the security of your data.

Webhooks
Webhooks can enhance your workflow by keeping your add-on up-to-date with the latest changes in Clockify. With Clockify’s webhooks you can receive real-time notifications when certain events such as starting timer or deleting time entry occur in Clockify. Workspace admins can create up to 10 webhooks each, with a total of 100 webhooks allowed per workspace.

Rate limiting
Our REST API has a specific rate limit of 50 requests per second (by addon on one workspace) when accessed using X-Addon-Token. Exceeding this limit will result in an error message with the description "Too many requests".

API URLs
Refer to the list on what URL to use base on the subdomain and data region settings of your workspace.

Global - can be used by workspaces with or without subdomain.
Regular: https://api.clockify.me/api/v1/file/image
Reports: https://reports.api.clockify.me/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/reports/detailed
Regional
Non-subdomain

Reports: https://developer.clockify.me/report/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/reports/detailed
Regional Server Prefixes
If your workspace is in a specific region, you need to change your URL prefix to access v1 API endpoints. For example, this is how backend api v1/file/image endpoint would look in EU region: https://euc1.clockify.me/api/v1/file/image

Below are the available regional server prefixes:

EU (Germany): euc1
USA: use2
UK: euw2
AU: apse2
Breaking changes
Breaking changes in APIs are modifications that disrupt existing integrations, requiring users to update their applications to maintain functionality. These changes can lead to failures or unexpected results if not addressed. See the list of breaking changes.

Experimental APIs
The experimental API has been thoroughly tested and is ready for use in production. However, please note that user feedback may lead to changes in the API’s structure or functionality. If you choose to use the experimental API, be prepared to modify your application code accordingly to accommodate any updates.

Entity Changes: Use cases
This section provides a step-by-step guide that shows you how to use the Entity Changes API to keep your system up to date with time entry data, including custom field values, without re-downloading everything each time.

💡 Note
Currently, this guide covers only one use case (custom field changes), but we plan to add more in the future.

Use Case: Keep Custom Field Values in Sync - Entity Changes Based on Detailed Report
This use case describes how to retrieve a full set of data (via the Detailed Report), then use incremental updates of custom fields or other supported types to stay in sync, including new, updated or deleted records.

Step 1: Get Initial Data Using the Detailed Report
Start by fetching time entries for a specified date range using the Detailed Report API. This is your baseline data (base dataset).

Below is an example that fetches data from May 1 to May 20, 2025.

Example: Get data from May 1 to May 20, 2025.

Use the curl command below:
curl --location 'https://{API_BASE_URL}/report/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/reports/detailed' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--data '{
    "dateRangeStart": "2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "dateRangeEnd": "2025-05-20T23:59:59.999Z"
}'
Sample response:
    {
      "timeentries": [
        {
          "_id": "1",
          "description": "Time entry 1",
          "timeInterval": {
            "start": "2025-05-18T01:00:00Z",
            "end": "2025-05-18T09:00:00.000Z"
          },
          "customFields": [
            {
              "customFieldId": "6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73",
              "value": "custom field value 1"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "_id": "2",
          "description": "Time entry 2",
          "timeInterval": {
            "start": "2025-05-19T01:00:00Z",
            "end": "2025-05-19T09:00:00.000Z"
          },
          "customFields": [
            {
              "customFieldId": "6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73",
              "value": "Custom field value 2"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
The response contains a list of time entries with all current custom field values. Save this in your database. You’ll use it to apply future changes

💡 Note
After this, you don’t need to fetch the full report again. Simply use the following steps to apply the changes.

Step 2: Retrieve Created Custom Field Values
Fetch any new custom field values added after the date range you fetched in Step 1.

Example: Get newly created values after May 20, 2025.

💡 Note
For the API specification see Created entities - Custom field values

Use the curl command below:
curl -X GET "https://{API_BASE_URL}/v1/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/entities/created?type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE&start=2025-05-21T00:00:00Z&end=2025-05-22T00:00:00Z&limit=30&page=1"
Sample response:
  [
    {
      "auditMetadata": {
        "updatedAt": "2025-05-21T04:00:00Z",
        "createdAt": "2025-05-21T03:00:00Z"
      },
      "documentType": "TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE",
      "id": "...",
      "customFieldId": "6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f85",
      "timeEntryId": "3",
      "value": "Custom field value 3"
        "sourceType": "TIMEENTRY"
    }
  ]
The response shows only newly created custom field values.

Each record has a timeEntryId, so you know which entry to update.

Add these new values to your stored data.

💡 Note
Run this daily, weekly, or as often as your app needs updates.

Step 3: Retrieve Updated Custom Field Values
Next, fetch custom field values that were updated after your original data.

Example: Get updates after May 20, 2025.

💡 Note
For API specification see Updated entities - Custom field values

Use the curl command below:
curl -X GET "https://{API_BASE_URL}/v1/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/entities/updated?type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE&start=2025-05-21T00:00:00Z&end=2025-05-22T00:00:00Z&limit=30&page=1"
Sample response:
  [
    {
      "auditMetadata": {
        "updatedAt": "2025-05-21T04:51:20Z",
        "createdAt": "2025-05-19T04:51:10Z"
      },
      "documentType": "TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE",
      "id": "...",
      "customFieldId": "6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73",
      "timeEntryId": "2",
      "value": "Custom field value 2 - Updated"
        "sourceType": "TIMEENTRY"
    }
  ]
The response shows only updated values within the specified date range.

Updates are linked to their timeEntryId.

Update the matching records in your database.

💡 Note
If a record was both created and updated in the same date range, it will only appear in the /created response, not /updated.

Step 4: Retrieve or Identify Deleted Custom Field Values
Finally, handle deletions. Use this step to retrieve any custom field values that were deleted after your initial date range and remove them from your own database.

Example: Get deletions after May 20, 2025.

💡 Note
For more information about this API, see Deleted entities - Custom field values

Use the curl command below:
curl -X GET "https://{API_BASE_URL}/v1/workspaces/{WORKSPACE_ID}/entities/deleted?type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE&start=2025-05-21T00:00:00Z&end=2025-05-22T00:00:00Z&limit=30&page=1"
Sample response:
  [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "deletionBinId": "....",
      "deletedAt": "2025-05-21T23:15:54.790Z",
      "documentType": "TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE",
      "document": {
        "customFieldId": "6808e9a6b77db953ea0d3f73",
        "timeEntryId": "1",
        "value": "custom field value 1",
        "sourceType": "TIMEENTRY"
      }
    }
  ]
The response contains references to the deleted values (e.g. timeEntryId and field ID).

Remove or archive these records in your system.

💡 Note
If a value was created and deleted in the same date range, it will not show up in the deleted results.

Supported types
This guide focuses on tracking custom field values (type=TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE).

The same approach can be applied to other data types. Simply change the type parameter in your requests and you can use the same steps for all supported types:

TIME_ENTRY
TIME_ENTRY_RATE
TIME_ENTRY_CUSTOM_FIELD_VALUE
We may support more types in the future as the system evolves.
